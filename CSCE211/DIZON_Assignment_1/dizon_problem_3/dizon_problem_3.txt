1. The goal of the maze is to find the exit. Therefore, in a two dimensional array, there is
two stacks. The stacks are to go up and down, and the other stack is to go left to right.
To solve a maze, regarding a two-dimensional array, as the index of the array changes, push out
data that hits a wall and go access the last position that wasn't a wall. Repeat this process until
it is solve, or in other words, the stack position is the exit.

2. The obvious criteria is that it has to be solvable. The next important aspect of making a
maze is the ability to be random. You don't want a maze that you already solved. It is important
that is random for how it looks and how difficult it is. The difficulty needs to be random in terms
of where there are walls and dead-ends. A maze can't be too easy or hard.
