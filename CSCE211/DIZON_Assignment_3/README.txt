For programs except 3 & 4: I ran into a problem where my methods were not being recognized.
The error was "undefined reference...". The solution was to include the class' cpp file into
the main cpp file header also. (ex. program 1's header files include both the .h and .cpp file 
of the class).

However, the programs should run flawlessly. I apologize for submitting it late.
